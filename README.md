## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One challenge that I encountered while improving on the app before submission was that I wanted to add backgrounds for each section, but they were not grouped together in div's already. I added div's with new ID's so that I could add these backgrounds. This also worked nicely for the navigation section because I could reference the new ID's within the anchor elements so users can navigate to a specific part of the page.
